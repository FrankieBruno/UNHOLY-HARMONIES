INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Unholy Harmonies, your one-stop-shop for exclusive artist merchandise. We offer 5 of our recommended metal artists along with their best four metal albums to date. So if you're a fan of hardcore metal and want to support your favorite artists, look no further than Unholy Harmonies. Our site will allow users to browse and search for albums, view information about each artist's albums, as well as see pictures of albums, tracklists, and customer reviews.

PURPOSE & MOTIVATION

My motivation for building a website in React.js was to gain a comprehensive understanding of its basic workings. To do this, I decided to choose a project idea that aligned with my interests, and that's when Unholy Harmonies came to mind. Being a heavy music enthusiast, it seemed like the perfect opportunity for me to dive into the intricacies of building a website without overwhelming myself.

To make this happen, I utilized various essential React features such as 'fetch' and 'useEffect' hooks, as well as 'params' and 'components'. These tools enabled me to create a dynamic website that can fetch data from various sources and display it on the frontend seamlessly. Overall, the project has given me valuable insights into React's fundamental concepts and allowed me to develop my skills in building interactive and engaging web applications.

HOW DOES THIS APPLICATION WORK?

Upon entering my website, users can easily log in or register to access their account, which allows them the ability to leave reviews on their favorite artists' albums.

Users can also create a customized wishlist by selecting their preferred albums.

In summary, my website not only offers a convenient platform for heavy metal lovers but also provides a range of user-friendly features, including review submission and wishlist creation, to elevate their overall experience.

HOW WAS THIS APPLICATION MADE?

I constructed this website utilizing the React framework for the frontend, along with a range of JavaScript components. These components incorporate various tools such as useEffects, fetch, functions, and JSX, which allowed me to deliver a responsive user experience. In addition, I leveraged CSS to design and style the site to achieve an aesthetically pleasing and visually engaging layout.

HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN THE APPLICATION?

    First, you will need to locate the folder in which the project is stored.
    Then, through your terminal, CD into the folder in which the project is saved.
    Now go to the folder in which the unholy-api is located and paste this code: json-server database.json -p 8088 -w.
    Next, in a separate terminal window, CD into your unholy folder and type "npm start".
    Lastly, a tab in your browser should open with the site loaded. The website address should be http://localhost:3000/login/.

DIFFICULTIES AND CHALLENGES FACED DURING THIS PROJECT

I had a lot of trouble at the start with comprehending useEffect, useParam, JSX, and the overall workings of React. One of the two most difficult tasks was trying to get my albums to appear on my artist tab and getting my albums to save to my wishlist.














# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
